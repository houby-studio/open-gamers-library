# Contributing

As a user, you can contribute by posting ideas and feature requests to [Github Issues][3]

As a developer, you can contribute just like to any other project, simply by taking over some task in [Github Issues][3], either feature requests, or fixing bugs.

Everyone has to read and follow our Code of conduct and Contributing guidance.

Source code is being linted upon Push or Pull requests and CI will 
fail if format breaks format rules. We follow [StandardJS][4] rules as they are standardized, quite simple and there are tools to easily format our code automatically.
